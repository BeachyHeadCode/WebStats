    <type>Block</type>
    <description>Grass is one of the most common blocks on the surfaces of maps. Grass is nearly identical to Dirt, with the main difference being that it can not be picked up by the player and placed. Dirt/Grass is required for plants like Saplings to grow. Grass doesn't fall when there are no blocks under it so its useful for creating building foundations. When Grass is destroyed Dirt is dropped, there is also a small chance that a Bone will be dropped. When Bonemeal is used on Grass a Tall Grass will be created on top of it.</description>

Cobblestones are mainly used in constructions of buildings and paths. Using a Furnace you can turn Cobblestone back into Stone. A Wood Pickaxe (or Higher) is required to break Cobblestone.</description>

    <type>Item</type>
    <description>The Redstone Comparator has two modes, Subtraction (when the single back torch is On) and Comparison (when the single back torch is Off). You can change the mode by Right Clicking on the Comparator. It has two inputs, one from the front (A) and one from either side (B). It outputs at the back (Where the single torch is). When in Subtraction mode it will output a redstone signal with the strength of A-B (So if A is 12 and B is 2, it will output a strength of 10). In Comparison mode it will output the strength of A if A is greater or equal to B's strength. If a block which has an inventory (like a Chest) is placed beside either of its inputs (A or B) it will use the amount of space used in the inventory as the signal strength. So if a Chest is full it would output a strength of 15, if empty a strength of 0 and other values if its in between.</description>

    <description>The Redstone Comparator has two modes, Subtraction (when the single back torch is On) and Comparison (when the single back torch is Off). You can change the mode by Right Clicking on the Comparator. It has two inputs, one from the front (A) and one from either side (B). It outputs at the back (Where the single torch is). When in Subtraction mode it will output a redstone signal with the strength of A-B (So if A is 12 and B is 2, it will output a strength of 10). In Comparison mode it will output the strength of A if A is greater or equal to B's strength. If a block which has an inventory (like a Chest) is placed beside either of its inputs (A or B) it will use the amount of space used in the inventory as the signal strength. So if a Chest is full it would output a strength of 15, if empty a strength of 0 and other values if its in between.</description>
