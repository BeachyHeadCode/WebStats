  <description>Grass is one of the most common blocks on the surfaces of maps. Grass is nearly identical to Dirt, with the main difference being that it can not be picked up by the player and placed. Dirt/Grass is required for plants like Saplings to grow. Grass doesn't fall when there are no blocks under it so its useful for creating building foundations. When Grass is destroyed Dirt is dropped, there is also a small chance that a Bone will be dropped. When Bonemeal is used on Grass a Tall Grass will be created on top of it.</description>
